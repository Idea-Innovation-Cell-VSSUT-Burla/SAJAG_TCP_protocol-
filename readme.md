<h2>Sajag TCP Protocol is algorithm written in python using the socket module in python 3.8.2</h2>

<p><strong>Sajag TCP Protocol is a open source project which is looking for open source contributors to further enhance the system it is a multiple client handling, through a single server project which uses the ip address of the communicating device to send and recieve messages from different clients to a single server</strong></p>

<h3>About the Project</h3>
<p>This TCP protocol is completely build on python_3.8.2 and Warning !!!! using any other python version may not work in it i.e. python2 will not work </p>

<h4>Dependencies and Installation Instructions on Linux(any distro will do, not tried on UNIX though)</h4>

Installations and Running it in linux

1.forking and cloning the repository

first fork the repository and clone it in your sysytem
git clone https://github.com/prasenjitghose36/SAJAG_TCP_protocol-.git

2.Checking the server for your system


chmod u+rwx check_server.py                        #giving permission to the file to cause changes
python check_server.py                             #the program runs and gives a eg -122.XX.XXX


3.Setting up the server which is your device


chmod u+rwx server.py                            #giving the root access to the file
python server.py                                 #the server is set up as the program runs in the terminal


4.Connecting your client with the server


chmod u+rwx client.py
python client.py

copy your machines id i.e. server id in the client.py code
and you can now send messages easily.


Installation guide for Windows


1.forking and cloning the repository

first fork the repository and clone it in your sysytem
git clone https://github.com/prasenjitghose36/SAJAG_TCP_protocol-.git


2.Checking the server for your system


./server_check.py                                #Run this in Windows PowerShell


3.Setting up the server which is your device


./server.py                                     #Run this in Windows PowerShell


4.Setting multiple clients and accessing the server


first copy the server ip address in the client code
./client,py
setup multiple clients using different windows in powershell and then send message enjoy :)
